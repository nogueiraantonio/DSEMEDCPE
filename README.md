Several Utils for developing on 3DX

1. MQL Triggers: 

Trigger Reset: It is not uncommon that when testing MQL triggers we end up messing the original trigger setup.

Please note that this will override any custom trigger handlers set on each of those elements but will not cleanup any "eService Trigger Program Params" objects.
